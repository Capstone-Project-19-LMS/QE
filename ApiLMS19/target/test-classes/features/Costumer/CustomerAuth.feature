  As an customer
  I want to authenticate
  So that I can use another feature


#  Scenario Outline: POST - As customer I have be able to create new account
#    Given I set POST api endpoints for register with "<name>", "<email>" and "<password>"
#    When I send POST HTTP request
#    Then I receive valid HTTP response code 200
#    And I receive valid data for new account
#
